<h1>Artist's Statement</h1>
<p>When I was younger, my goals in life were broad. I wanted to change the world for the better. I wanted to go to MIT and be the sort of person who wins a Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Now my goals are slightly different. I still wish to change the world, leave it better than I found it, but I want to do that through my art. I don't want to be rich or famous, I just want a world where people can express themselves freely. I want to be someone who pushes the envelope of society, who makes progress that is real and tangible even if on a small scale. Art is often integral to wider societal changes and movements. I'd like to be a piece of that puzzle.</p>
